# Database Analytics Project  
## Bay Area Bike Share

### Description
This project focuses on creating a database using a 6GB dataset from Kaggle, named "Bay Area Bike Share." The dataset contains structured data from the years 2013 and 2014, providing information about bike trips, station status, and station details. The goal is to use SQL to extract meaningful insights for business strategies.

## Key Steps and Analysis
### Dataset Selection
Dataset (called Bay Area Bike Share) concerning bike travels around the San Francisco Bay Area was selected from the website kaggle.com [check here](#https://www.kaggle.com/).
- station.csv
- status.csv
- trip.csv

### Business Understanding

Defined goals such as identifying time-consuming journeys, quantifying rides lasting over a day, and determining user patterns.

### Data Understanding

Explored each column in the tables (Trip, Status, Station) to understand values and relationships.
Checked for missing values, outliers, and data errors.

### Design a Database

Conducted requirement analysis, normalized the schema, and created an ER diagram.
Translated the ER diagram into relations and implemented the database in MySQL.

### Data Cleaning and Database Testing

Checked numeric and character columns for statistics, missing values, and outliers.
Tested queries to ensure database results aligned with expectations and constraints were working.
